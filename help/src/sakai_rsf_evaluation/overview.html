<h2>Course Evaluation: Overview</h2>
<p>The  Course Evaluation tool in Vula provides a means of surveying site participants for the purposes of course evaluation, feedback and review. It can  also be used to gather anonymous data for other forms of research and analysis. </p>
<p>The tool has a suite of standard templates which can be used as they are or adapted to suit your needs. If necessary, templates can also be made from scratch and added to the public list for others to see and share. Question types and rating scales allow for flexible design and structure, while detailed settings control which lecturers and tutors are being evaluated, how participants access the survey, and who may view the results. Several reporting options are also available to help you collate and analyse responses.</p>
